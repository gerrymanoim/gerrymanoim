<h3 align="center"> Hey there! 👋 I'm Gerry.</h3>
<p align="center">It's nice to meet you.</p>

I'm currently a Software Engineer in Boston working at [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/) where I mostly spend my time on Data Engineering and build tooling in Python and C++. In a past life I lived in NYC and worked on equity trading algorithm research and providing data APIs, mostly using R and Q/kbd.

Lately I've been spending some time on:

- Making things go fast 🔥🔥🔥 with Python and C++ via [libpy](https://github.com/quantopian/libpy) (most recently in [libpy_simdjson](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/libpy_simdjson)) 
- Automating 👏All👏The👏Things👏 with Github Actions (I'm always very happy to see [PR Prefix Labler](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/pr-prefix-labeler) respond to my PRs)
- Finding better ways [to listen](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/to-listen) to more music in spotify 🎶
- WebAssembly Experiments (most recently [Static Searcher](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/static-searcher))
