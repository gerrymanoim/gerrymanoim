<p align="center">It's nice to meet you.</p>

I'm currently a Software Engineer in New York, NY working at [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) where I mostly spend my time on building tools for modelers and improving the research process.

Lately I've been spending some time on:

- The [dask](https://github.com/dask/dask) backend to [ibis](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis)
- [Git-scraping](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) some [snow reports](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/snow_report)
- Automating 👏All👏The👏Things👏 with Github Actions (I'm always very happy to see [PR Prefix Labler](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/pr-prefix-labeler) respond to my PRs)
- Finding better ways [to listen](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/to-listen) to more music in spotify 🎶
